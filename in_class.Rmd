Join `weather` and `airports` (will need some intermediate steps)  

```{r}
weather_airports <- flights %>%
  left_join(weather, by = c("origin", "year","month","day","hour")) %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("origin" = "faa"))

weather_airports

```


From the `weather_airports` data you created (via joining tables). Find the average `distance` the `carrier` `UA` flies whose `origin` is `JFK`
```{r}
weather_airports %>%
  filter(origin == "JFK") %>%
  filter(carrier == 'UA') %>%
  summarize(avg = mean(distance))
```


Similar to the previous statement, calculate the average `distance` of each `carrier` whose `origin` is `JFK` and display them from highest to lowest.
```{r}
weather_airports %>%
  filter(origin == "JFK") %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarize(avg = mean(distance)) %>%
  arrange(-avg)
  
```

Display a plot of the top 5 `carrier` that flew the greatest overall distance in March of 2013, result should show `carrier` as well as `total_distance`
```{r}
top5 <- weather_airports %>%
  filter(year == 2013, month == 3) %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarize(
    total_distance = sum(distance)
  ) %>%
  arrange(total_distance) %>%
  top_n(5, total_distance)

top5 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(carrier, total_distance), y=total_distance)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()
```


Which `planes` `model` was the most common in `year` 2004?
```{r}
planes %>% 
  filter(year == 2004) %>%
  group_by(model) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(-n) %>%
  head(1) 
```

Show a histogram with 20 bins of the `hour` from `flights`.
```{r}
flights %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=hour)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20)
```


Make a scatter plot of `average_distance` from `flights` with the x-axis as `carrier` `UA` and y-axis as `carrier` `AA`
```{r}
flights %>%
  filter(carrier == 'UA' | carrier == 'AA') %>%
  group_by(carrier, day) %>%
  summarize(avg_dist = mean(distance)) %>%
  spread(key = carrier, value = avg_dist) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=UA,y=AA)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
  
```


Create a linear model between `dep_delay` and `arr_delay` where `arr_delay` is the target variable.
```{r}
# No base-rate with multi-factor targets?

# train_control = trainControl(method='cv', number=10)
# 
# model_lm = model_nb = train(
#   # dat_train_up %>% select(-Class), different way to pass in x,y
#   # dat_train_up$Class,
#   Class ~ .,
#   data = dat_train_up,
#   trControl = train_control,
#   method = 'lm'
# )
# model_lm
```

To the lay person, describe what the coefficients from your model mean?

Assume all data is already cleaned. From the `planes` table, using `year`, `engine`, and `seats` - build a model to predict `manufacturer` (filtered for you). Describe your model and interpret your results.
```{r}
clean_data <- planes %>% 
  filter(manufacturer %in% c('BOEING', 'AIRBUS INDUSTRIE', 'BOMBARDIER INC', 'AIRBUS', 'EMBRAER'))

dat <- clean_data %>% rename(Class = manufacturer)

dat <- dat %>% mutate(id = row_number())
sample_volume = round(0.7 * nrow(dat))
dat_train = dat %>%
  sample_n(sample_volume)
dat_test = dat %>%
  anti_join(dat_train, by = 'id')
dat_train = dat_train %>% select(-id)
dat_test = dat_test %>% select(-id)

train_control = trainControl(method='cv', number=10)

dat_train

model_ranger = model_nb = train(
  dat_train %>% select(-Class),
  dat_train$Class,
  trControl = train_control,
  importance = "impurity",
  method = 'ranger'
)
model_ranger
```



```{r}
predictions = predict(model_ranger, newdata = dat_test, type = 'raw')
actuals = dat_test$Class
confusionMatrix(predictions, actuals)
```
